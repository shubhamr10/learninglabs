**Using While Loop:**

2. Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
3. Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number using a while loop.
4. Write a program that checks if a given number is prime using a while loop.

**Using If-Else and Else-If:**

5. Write a program that determines whether a given number is odd or even.
6. Write a program that finds the largest of three numbers.
7. Write a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.

**Using `java.util.Random()`:**

8. Write a program that generates and prints a random number between 1 and 100.
9. Write a program that simulates rolling a six-sided dice and prints the result.

**Creating an Array of Strings:**

10. Write a program that initializes an array of strings with names of fruits and prints them.
11. Write a program that sorts an array of strings in alphabetical order.
12. Write a program that finds the longest and shortest string in an array of strings.
