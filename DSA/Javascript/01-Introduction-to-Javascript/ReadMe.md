## What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is a loosely typed, dyamic and interpreted language.
- JavaScript was initally created to make web-pages alive.
- JavaScript can run on browser as well as on servers.
- We need a JavaScript Engine to run JavaScript.
- Most common JavaScript Engine is chrome's **V8**.


> Key Terms

- Loosely Typed - means there is no static checking for data types. You can assign value of any data type to a variable.
- Interpreted Language - means it is just-in-time compiled while running. It's not pre-compiled.
- Dynamic - Javascript has capability to dynamically construct objects, variables without the need to pre-define the elements.


## History of JavaScript?

- It was created by Bredon Eich in 1995.
- It was first named *"Mocha"*, then was changed to *"LiveScript"* and then finally to *"JavaScript"*.
- JavaScript has nothing to do with Java. "Java" in the naming was just used for the naming convention.

## JavaScript Version
- ECMAScript is a specification used for JavaScript to manage it's release and standards.
- ES1 was released in June 1997.
- The first major release was ES5 or ECMAScript 2009.
- Then came ES6 or ECMAScript 2015 which we use as a modern javascript.
- Every year JavaScript releases some changes.

## How to run javascript

- You can create a `.js` file and add it to a html to run it on browsers.
- On servers, you need to install node.js and then can directly run a javascript file using `node filename.js`.

## Difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript

- **JavaScript** : JavaScript is a general purpose scripting languages that conforms/obeys ECMAScript specifications.
- **ECMAScript** : The specification defined in ECMA-262 for creating a general purpose scripting language.
